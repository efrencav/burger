# Eat-Da-Burger!

# Challenge
Build a burger manager using handlebars.js! I decided to theme the burger manager after the beloved In-N-Out (though this doesn't mean I think it's the best...). Using the text form, users can add new burgers to devour. 

# User Guide
<img src="./public/assets/images/upNOut.png" 
alt="burger mgr" width="500" height="300" border="10" /></a>

Here's how it works:

- Clone repo to your computer
- `npm install` in your CLI to download appropriate dependencies
- Create the respective database and table
- Open the browser to localhost:8080 and use the form!
- Press the create button after entering a new burger
- Press the devour button to devour the burger
- Have fun!

The game uses basic concepts in express, handlebars and MVC. A very fun way to start playing with the MVC concept especially!
